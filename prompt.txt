Create a Foundry VTT dialog titled "Spell Selector" with the following structured layout and behavior:

Overall Layout & Styling

The dialog should be centered on the screen and sized at 75% of the window’s width and 80% of its height.
the dialog must contain a table with some fixed rows that are not scrollable. Filter row, Table row, and Button row.

Filter row (Top)
Contains a text input field (with a placeholder "Find spell...") for filtering spells by name.
Contains a dropdown (select input) populated dynamically with class names extracted from a Spell Journal compendium.
A dropdown pupulated dynamically with spell ranks from cantrip to 9th level.
This section should be fixed at the top of the dialog and remain visible when scrolling and be of the size of the first row.

Table row (Middle)
the secnd row of the tale after the filter row, contains the headers of the columns.
from this row onwars the table should have 4 columns.
Checkbox Column: A narrow column containing checkboxes for spell selection. As wide as the checkboxes themselves.
Name Column: Displays the spell's name; text should be left-aligned. this is the column that can be widened to fill the dialog’s width.
Level Column: Displays the spell's level, showing "Cantrip" if the level is 0. The size of this coulumn should be fixed 50px.
Range Column: Displays the spell's range. The size of this coulumn should be fixed 50px.

Button row (Bottom)
This row will have a single button with the text "Accept". the size of the button 100px wide height same size as all other rows

Functionality & Behavior

When the user types into the "Name" input or changes the "Class" dropdown, the table updates dynamically to filter the spell list accordingly.
Spell data is loaded asynchronously from a Spell Journal compendium and a spells compendium pack (using functions like fromUuid()), with proper handling when no spells are found.
The checkbox in the first column allows for selection of individual spells.
