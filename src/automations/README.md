Hook-activated automations.

## Naming conventions

- Use lower camelCase for automation methods (e.g. `jackOfAllTrades`, `mantleOfMajesty`).
- Use one method per feature name; do not create level-suffixed variants unless mechanics are truly distinct.
- Keep class and subclass names in PascalCase and file names in kebab-case.
- Normalize feature names by removing spaces, apostrophes, and hyphens when converting to method names.
